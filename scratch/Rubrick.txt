My Project:

Create a web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 1 to the chosen number with the following exceptions:

* Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "ping"
* Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "pong"
* Numbers divisible by 15 are replaced with "pingpong"

A user should be able to enter a new number and see new results over and over again.



Objectives:

* JavaScript business logic and user interface logic are separate
* Variable names are descriptive and use lower camel case (e.g. myVariableExample)
* Code has proper indentation and spacing
* All previous objectives have been met




Further exploration (optional):

If you finish meeting the objectives for this project, consider adding additional features, such as:

* recreate the example layout
* add images
* implement different behaviors/effects/images for different inputs
